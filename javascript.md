# What is Hoisting?
>In JavaScript, hoisting is a behavior where **variable** and **function** declarations >are **moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase**, before >the code is executed. 
>>This means that you can use a variable or a function in your code **before** it's >>**declared** in the source code..
