# MyNotes
# What is Hoisting?
>In JavaScript, hoisting is a behavior where **variable** and **function** declarations are **moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase**, before the code is executed. 
>>This means that you can use a variable or a function in your code **before** it's  **declared** in the source code..
>> * Variable Hoisting .

>console.log(x); // undefined .
>var x = 5; .
>console.log(x); // 5 .
